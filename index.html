    I love youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu<br><br>

    Thank you for making me happy.<br>
    Thank You. for existing.<br><br>

    You are the favoritest person I have ever met, you are the one person i would always like to see smile, I really want you to be the happiest person and i want to do as much as i can to make you smile.<br><br>

    I chose this song because thats what i felt when i talked to you That day. i really was enchanted and i really hoped you weren't in love with someone else.<br><br>

    And the days went on and i kept falling and falling again until I was so consumed in my head that i could not keep it in any longer and decided to confess to you however lame it was ( sorry :L ), and the day you confessed to me aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah happened and so on and so on and here we are<br><br>

    I thank you for everything really and i love you for everything, for trusting me with you for being You with me and letting myself be Me<br><br>

    Free writing ho la j mind ma ayo tei lekhdai chu im not so good at writing<br><br>

    We both know how our future is.. but i don't care about that right now, for today I am so so Happy its you and really really grateful that <strong>You are my Valentine 💖</strong>
